# Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction: A Comparison of Logistic Regression and Random Forest on Portuguese Company Data

This repository is part of the directed research carried out on the Master in Finance Program presented as part o the requirements for the Award of a Master Degree in Finance from the NOVA - School of Business and Economics

The repository contains five notebooks which are leading to the final results:

1. dataset preparation notebook (prep_datasets)<br />
This notebook contains necessary steps in order to prepare the dataset for the models.

2. feature engineering notebook (feature_eng)<br />
This notebook contains all necessary and possible feature engineering step, including imputing missing values, train-test-split and data transformation.

3. grid search notebook (gridsearch)<br />
This notebook contains the grid search code in order to find the best hyperparameter for the random forest model as well as for the logistic regression model.

4. logistic regression classifier notebook (final_model_logistic_regression)<br />
This notebook contains the code for training the logistic regression model, testing the model and measuring the performance including confusion matrix, ROC Curve, AUC, sensitivity and specificity. 

5. random forest classifier notebook (final_model_random_forests)<br />
This notebook contains the code for training the random forest model, testing the model and measuring the performance including confusion matrix, ROC Curve, AUC, sensitivity and specificity.
